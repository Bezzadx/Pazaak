# Pazaak
This repository contains a functioning version of the card game, Pazaak, which currently can be played through python interactive mode.
Included are four AI agents which you can play against, or have play against each other. 
'bot' makes decisions from a hardcoded algorithm, using a naive understanding of what 'good play' looks like.
'ai' makes decisions using a mixture of q-learning and a hardcoded evaluation function.
'bot_plus' makes decisions by combining 'bot's decision making algorithm with a simple Monte Carlo Search.
'ai_plus' makes decisions by combining 'ai's decision making process with a simple Monte Carlo Search.
This project is entirely my own work, although some inspiration was taken from Harvard CS50's implementation of Nim.
